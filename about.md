- At in28Minutes, we ask ourselves one question everyday. How do we create more effective trainings?
- We use Problem-Solution based Step-By-Step Hands-on Approach With Practical, Real World Application Examples. 
- 50,000 Students on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/in28minutes/) and 30,000 Subscribers on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/rithustutorials/playlists) are proofs about the success of our approach.
- While our primary expertise is on Development, Design & Architecture Java & Related Frameworks (Spring, Struts, Hibernate) we are expanding into the front-end world (Bootstrap, JQuery, Angular JS). 

### Our Beliefs
- Best Course are interactive and fun.
- Foundations for building high quality applications are best laid down while learning.

### Our Approach
- Problem Solution based Step by Step Hands-on Learning
- Practical, Real World Application Examples.
- We use 80-20 Rule. We discuss 20% things used 80% of time in depth. We touch upon other things briefly equipping you with enough knowledge to find out more on your own. 
- We will be developing a demo application in the course, which could be reused in your projects, saving hours of your effort.
- All the code is available on Github, for most steps.
